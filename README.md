# Project Name :- John Hopkins Covid 19
Concluding the time series analysis on the John Hopkins dataset for confirmed COVID-19 cases in the US, the ARIMA model with an RMSE of 12007.75 emerged as the best fit, providing a reasonable level of accuracy given the dataset's size. Challenges encountered included the need to interact separately with multiple datasets, prompting the decision to combine them for a comprehensive analysis. The choice to use ARIMA over SARIMAX was influenced by the dataset's nature. A significant difficulty was in determining the optimal ARIMA parameters (p, d, q), requiring thorough exploration and iterative testing. Despite challenges, the ARIMA model showcased its effectiveness in capturing the temporal patterns of COVID-19 cases in the US, providing valuable insights for forecasting and decision-making.
